# Seed Data Instructions

The file `seed_games.csv` contains the curated game list to pre-populate the SQLite database. Each row has a title, platform (ps2/gc/ps1/n64/snes/genesis), genre, curated_vibe (essential or hidden_gem), a rawg_slug for deterministic RAWG API lookups, and a curated_desc with the recommendation blurb.

Write a seed migration or startup function that reads this CSV and inserts each row into the `games` table, generating a UUID for the `id` field and mapping the CSV columns directly to the corresponding database columns. If a game with the same `rawg_slug` and `platform` already exists, skip it so the seed is idempotent. The `rawg_slug` field is used for enrichment — when fetching data from RAWG, call `GET /games/{rawg_slug}` directly instead of searching by title, which avoids ambiguous matches (e.g. remakes vs originals). Some slugs are best-guess based on RAWG's URL patterns and may return a 404 — if a slug fails, fall back to searching by title with `search_precise=true` filtered to the correct platform, and update the stored slug with whatever RAWG returns. Include the CSV file as a bundled asset or embed the data directly in the seed script — either approach is fine.
